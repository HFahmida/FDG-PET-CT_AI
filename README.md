# FDG-PET-CT_AI
This repository is created to release the model weights for the following paper: "Development and validation of pan-cancer lesion segmentation AI-model for whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT in diverse clinical cohorts"
We have used 3D full resolution nnUNet model( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01008-z) and the model was developed using the same instruction as by the nnUNet repository (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).
