# FDG-PET/CT_AI
This repository is created to release the model weights for the following paper: "Development and validation of pan-cancer lesion segmentation AI-model for whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT in diverse clinical cohorts"



We have used 3D full resolution nnUNet model( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01008-z) and the model was developed using the same instruction as by the nnUNet repository (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet). 



For model development: AUTOPET open access dataset has been used. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/fdg-pet-ct-lesions/




Model weights can be downloaded from google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1luNhXZtdn2d12nPmLOMWTAjNCiqQOu4u?usp=sharing
